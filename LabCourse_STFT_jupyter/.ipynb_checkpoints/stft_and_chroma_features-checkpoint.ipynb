    "Audio signals can be complex mixtures consisting of a multitude of different sound components.\n",

    "In the case that these building blocks consist of complex-valued sinusoidal\n",

    "The Fourier transform maps a time-dependent signal\n",
    "to a frequency-dependent function which reveals the spectrum of\n",

    "Loosely speaking, a signal and its Fourier transform are two sides\n",

    "On the one side, the signal displays the time information and hides the\n",
    "information about frequencies.\n",
    "On the other side, the Fourier transform reveals information about\n",
    "frequencies and hides the time information.\n",

    "To obtain back the hidden time information, Dennis Gabor introduced\n",
    "in the year 1946 the modified Fourier transform, now known as\n",
